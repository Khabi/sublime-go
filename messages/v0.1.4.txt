- addons: a new experimental plugin has been added `staticcheck`

The addong is disabled by default (no checks configured), see the settings to enable
it. It runs on `post_save`, if you encounter any issues with staticcheck please
report to https://github.com/yields/sublime-go/issues.

- config: a new setting `vet.run_on_post_save` has been added.

The default is `true` which causes vet to run on post_save, you can change
it to `false`.

To run vet again, you can either use the command pallet `go: vet` or add your
own keybinding to run it.
