This package aims to provide a robust Go plugin for Sublime Text.

Dependencies:

  - `>=go1.13` (https://golang.org/dl/)
  - `goimports(1)` (https://golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
  - `golint(1)` (https://github.com/golang/lint)
  - `gocode(1)` (https://github.com/visualfc/gocode)
  - `guru(1)` (https://golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru)


Bugs:

If you encounter any errors, annoyances, slowness please report
the issue over at https://github.com/yields/sublime-go.


Setup:

Once you've got all of the dependencies installed, make sure that sublime
has access to go(1) binary, to do so, you can run this snippet in the console:

```
import os; os.environ['PATH']
```

If the $PATH that contains go(1) is not there, you'll have to add it manually
in the plugin settings, run the command `Go: settings`, and add the path to `go(1)`:

```
{
  "root": "/usr/local/go/bin"
}
```

Note: some command line utilities can be slow depending on the code, in that case
the plugin shows a small activity indicator in the status bar.
